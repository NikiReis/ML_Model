# Machine Learning Model
Machine Learning model built in the Introduction To Data Science from Digital Innovation One's Data Engineering Bootcamp.

## Context:
  This repository is indeed to save te data and the algorithms aplied in the "Introduction To Data Science Course" from Carrefour Bank - Data Engineer Bootcamp.
  
  The database used was a famous titanic database from kaggle.com that was used in a lot of Machine Learning Competitions. This database cotains some data about the people that were in that incident. The objetive of our Machine Learning model is try to predict the surviving rate.
